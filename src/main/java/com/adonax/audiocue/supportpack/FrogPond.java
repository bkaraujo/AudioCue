/**
 * {@code FrogPond} is part of <em>AudioCueSupportPack</em>, 
 * a collection of classes and assets used to demonstrate the 
 * {@code AudioCue} class. {@code FrogPond} illustrates an 
 * example of creating an ambient, aleatory soundscape from 
 * a minimum of assets.
 * <p>
 * All the frogs heard derive from concurrent instances of
 * a single {@code AudioCue} playing the asset "frog.wav", 
 * a frog croak. Random numbers within carefully defined 
 * ranges are used as volume, panning and frequency arguments 
 * to give the sense that there are many frogs a different 
 * angles and distances relative to the listener.
 * <p>
 * This class implements {@code AudioCueListener}. Implementation 
 * methods are limited to simply reporting brief messages on the 
 * console when called.
 * <p>
 * This class makes use of the following wav file:
 * <ul><li>frog.wav</li></ul>
 * <p>
 * The asset should be placed in a sub-folder directly 
 * below this folder, with the sub-folder named "res".
 * A copy of the asset will be maintained at the following 
 * url:
 * <ul><li>https://github.com/philfrei/AudioCue/tree/master/src/main/java/com/adonax/audiocue/supportpack/res</li></ul>
